# OS_P4
Operating Systems Project 4 (http://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse30341/spring2017/project4/project4.html)

This project was completed by Andrew Paek (apaek1) and Douglas Schmieder (Dschmied). To compile this project, just use the Makefile by running make. The makefile will compile the code to the executable "site-tester", which can by run by a user. Please note that secondary files (config-file, sites-file, and search-files) are necessary to correctly run this code. The default files are "ExampleSites.txt", and "ExampleSearch.txt".
